    <h1>Our Policy</h1>
    <p>This is a bot that creates value from waste. Our audiences include two group of people. One is customers who need decluttering service to help them bring unwanted stuff away. Another one is cooperators, including designers, artists, and craftsmen who can use the unwanted stuff to create new pieces/ products. They are working on related things or they have the skills of turning old things into new products. </p>
